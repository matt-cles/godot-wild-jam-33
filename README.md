## Godot Wild Jam #33
### You aren't the Hero

This game is my submission for the Godot Wild Jam #33, "You aren't the Hero"

My take on the theme is that, rather than being the bad guy fighting the Hero, you would play as the Hero's assistant. I decided to make the player characters role being the Hero's item management. The Hero will proceed to fight the enemies on his own, relying on the player, to give him the item that he needs to get his job done (which is of course beating up the baddies). 

Different enemies have different weaknesses, so it's the assistants job to keep track of which weapons are effective against which types of enemies. The player will also need to ensure that the Hero does not run out of Health (red bar), Mana (blue bar), or Stamina (yellow bar). If the Hero's Stamina runs out, then he will be unable to swing his weapon, if his Mana runs out, then he will be unable to use the magical staffs, and if the Hero's health runs out, then the Hero will fall in battle and the Game will be over!

If the assistant does a good job managing the Hero's inventory, monitoring the Hero's Health, Mana, and Stamina, and remembering the weapons that are the most effective against the different types of enemies, then they can help the Hero can defeat many more enemies than he ever could on his own!

I hope you enjoy Item Assistant! This is my first full game made in Godot Engine and my first ever Game Jam submission. I have learned a lot in making this game, and I hope that you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it! Cheers, and thanks for playing!
