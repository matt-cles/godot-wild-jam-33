## Game: Item Assistant

In this game, you are the assistant to the Hero. Your job is to give the Hero the item that they need to defeat the enemies. Different enemies have different weaknesses! Keep an eye out for which weapons are effective against which enemies. You will also need to ensure that the Hero does not run out of Health, Mana, or Stamina, so be sure to give them the proper potions when they need a refreshment!
