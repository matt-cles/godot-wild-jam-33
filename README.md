# Item Assistant

[Item Assistant Title Screen](/screen_shots/title_screen.png?raw=true)

In this game, you are the assistant to the Hero. Your job is to give the Hero the item that they need to defeat the enemies. Different enemies have different weaknesses! Keep an eye out for which weapons are effective against which enemies. You will also need to ensure that the Hero does not run out of Health, Mana, or Stamina, so be sure to give them the proper potions when they need a refreshment! If Stamina runs out, then the Hero can't swing any weapon, if Mana runs out, then the hero is unable to use the magical staffs, and if the Hero's health runs out, then the Hero will fall in battle and the Game will be over!

## Godot Wild Jam #33
### You aren't the Hero

This game is my submission for the Godot Wild Jam #33, "You aren't the Hero"

My take on the theme is that, rather than being the bad guy fighting the Hero, you would play as the Hero's assistant. I decided to make the player characters role being the Hero's item management. The Hero will proceed to fight the enemies on his own, relying on the player, the assistant, to give him the item that he needs to get his job done (which is of course beating up the baddies). 

I hope you enjoy this game! 

Controls:
- `Left Arrow Key`: Switch to the previous item in your inventory
- `Right Arrow Key`: Switch to the next item in your inventory
- `Spacebar/Enter Key`: Swap items with the Hero
- `Escape Key`: Pause the game
